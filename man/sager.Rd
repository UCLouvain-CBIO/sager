\title{Analysing sage results with R}
\description{
The \code{sager} package can be used to import results produced by the
sage search engine into R. Sage produces tab-separated output
files for identification and quantitation results. In \code{sager}, we
import these result files into establised Bioconductor classes:
\itemize{
\item Identification results are parsed and imported as
\code{\link[PSMatch:PSM]{PSMatch::PSM()}} objects with \code{\link[=sagePSM]{sagePSM()}}.
\item Quantitation (and identification) results are parsed, merged and
imported as \code{\link[QFeatures:QFeatures-class]{QFeatures::QFeatures()}} objects with
\code{\link[=sageQFeatures]{sageQFeatures()}}.
\item It is also possible to import quantitation, identification and
raw spectra into an \code{\link[MsExperiment:MsExperiment]{MsExperiment::MsExperiment()}} object with
\code{\link[=sageMsExperiment]{sageMsExperiment()}}.
}

These functions are described and demonstrated in their respective
manual pages using data generated from Yu \emph{et al.} 'Benchmarking
the Orbitrap Tribrid Eclipse for Next Generation Multiplexed
Proteomics', downloaded from ProteomeXchange project
PXD016766. See \code{\link[=sagerData]{sagerData()}} for details.
