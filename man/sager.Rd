\title{Analysing sage results with R}
\description{
The sager package can be used to results produced by the sage
search engine. Sage produces tab-separated output files for
identification and quantitation results. In \code{sager}, we import
these result files into establised Bioconductor classes:
\itemize{
\item Identification results are parsed and imported as
\code{\link[PSMatch:PSM]{PSMatch::PSM()}} objects with \code{\link[=sagerPSM]{sagerPSM()}}.
\item Quantitation (and identification) results are parsed and as
\code{\link[QFeatures:QFeatures-class]{QFeatures::QFeatures()}} objects.
\item It is also possible to import quantitation, identification and
raw spectra into an \code{\link[MsExperiment:MsExperiment]{MsExperiment::MsExperiment()}} object.
}

These functions are described in their respective manual pages
with data generated from Yu \emph{et al.} 'Benchmarking the Orbitrap
Tribrid Eclipse for Next Generation Multiplexed Proteomics',
downloaded from ProteomeXchange project PXD016766. See
\code{\link[=sagerData]{sagerData()}} for details.
